In this lab, we learned how to navigate the directory in the terminal. We first used "git clone" to clone a git repository and clone it into EdStem. 
Once we did this we used commands like pwd to view the current directory and ls to list out the files in the current directory. 
We ran some "Hello World!" files in different languages. By compiling and then running the java file, we could print these different messages. 

Side note: we also discussed which ruler is the best, and I chose this flexible pink ruler for several reasons. First, a good ruler is a ruler that can adapt in any situation, therefore, flexibility is key. Also it was pink, and pink is my favorite color so obviously it's going to be the best.
